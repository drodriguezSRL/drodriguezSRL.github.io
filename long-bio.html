				<h2>Long Biography</h2>

				<p>Thanks to a research grant from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities, I joined the University of Malaga's Department of Systems Engineering and Automation as a Beatriz Galindo Junior Professor in December 2024. I'm currently part of the <a href="https://www.uma.es/space-robotics">Space Robotics Lab</a> working with <a href="https://www.uma.es/isa/info/76432/cperez/">Prof. Carlos Pérez del Pulgar</a>, where we're pushing autonomy in space robotics. My own work focuses on next-generation <b>autonomous navigation</b> pipelines and <b>mobility concepts</b> for robots deployed in extreme environments. Right now, we're exploring how to make mobile exploration robots faster, more reliable, and far more human-independent using <b>single-photon vision technology</b>.
				
				<p>I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain, but spent most of my early research career abroad. It all kicked off in 2014 with my first master's thesis (I've done a couple) under the guidance of <a href="https://barbero.cadec-online.com/">Prof. Ever Barbero</a> from the <a href="https://mae.statler.wvu.edu/">Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</a> at West Virginia University (WVU) and co-directed by <a href="https://researchportal.uc3m.es/display/inv15631">Prof. Carlos Navarro Ugena</a> from the <a href="https://researchportal.uc3m.es/display/dep286">Continuum Mechanics and Structural Analysis group</a> at the Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M). Since then, I've been part of international projects, founded initiatives, and led research teams in seven countries across three continents. Along the way, I earned BSc and MSc degrees in Mechanical Engineering from UC3M in Spain (2008-15), a master's degree in Space Studies from the International Space University (ISU) in France (2015-16), and a Ph.D. in Robotics and Aerospace Engineering from Tohoku University in Japan (2017-20).</p> 
				
				<p>Early in my Phd, around 2018, I kicked off a first-of-its-kind collaboration (that I know of) between the European Space Agency (ESA) and Tohoku University: the <b>“High-speed lunar locomotion”</b> project. With support from <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37725307700">Michel Van Winnendael</a> at ESA and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mzUOHycAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Prof. Kazuya Yoshida</a> at the <a href="http://www.astro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/e/">Space Robotics Lab (SRL)</a>, we challenged a long-standing assumption in planetary exploration: that rovers must move slowly. We started to look at ways to enable lunar rovers to travel at speeds two orders of magnitude higher than those of current missions. By the end of my PhD, we had built a team at the SRL with one additional PhD student, four master's students, and one exchange student. Together, we co-authored the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rob.21912">first comprehensive review dedicated to high-speed mobility on planetary surfaces</a>. We built and tested a prototype of a new robot (Explorer 1) designed with a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10325569">novel suspension mechanism capable of withstanding the perturbations expected during high-speed travel on unstructured planetary terrains</a>, which has been recently featured by <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/lnews/tottori/20231114/4040016512.html">NHK News</a>. And with the support of the German Aerospace Center, we conducted the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02167">most extensive testing campaign to date on the effects of speed on the interaction between rover wheels and planetary soil simulants</a>. The enduring impact of our research is still tangible today. The group at Tohoku University continues to spearhead research efforts on the effects of speed on off-road robotic mobility. Meanwhile, ESA has initiated new <a href="https://www.gmv.com/en/communication/press-room/press-releases/robotic-and-scientific-exploration/gmv-tests-lunar-rover">industry- and academic-led projects</a> on the subject of faster navigation in planetary environments.</p>
				
				<p>After finishing my PhD, I took a brief detour from academia and joined the <a href="https://espace.epfl.ch/">EPFL Space Center (eSpace)</a>, where I spent 2.5 years founding and directing <a href="https://lunar.epfl.ch/">EPFL's Lunar Hub</a>, a home base for Swiss lunar research and technology development. During this period, I contributed as project manager for EPFL in multiple university-industry collaborative projects including the <a href="https://espace.epfl.ch/research/past-projects/innosuisse/">capture system concept validation and relative navigation technologies for failed satellite removal</a> alongside the company ClearSpace and <a href="https://www.ariane.group/en/news/a-family-of-reusable-and-eco-friendly-launchers-for-europe/">New European Space Transportation Solutions (NESTS)</a>, led by Ariane Group and formed by a large consortium of private entities such as Airbus, Thales Alenia Space, Telespazio, Orbex, and D-Orbit. In house, we launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Drone (LRD) project to explore the feasibility of <b>designing and deploying a compact, fully autonomous drone for high-resolution mapping of hardly accessible lunar regions</b>. The work conducted was presented in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VETMHc3TSZE&t=473s">major international forums</a> and a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009457652400064X">paper describing the outcome of this project</a> was published in Acta Astronautica</p> 

				<p>In early-2022, I founded <a href="https://hermes-workshop.com/">HERMES</a>, an international working group formed by renowned field scientists, researchers, and industry experts on the subject of heterogeneous multi-robot cooperation for exploration and science in extreme environments. The group has since gained prominence, culminating in the <a href="https://hermes-workshop.com/2023.html">1st International HERMES Workshop</a> held at the IEEE/RAS 2023 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in London, which was attended onsite by about 150 people and hosted more than 20 speakers. Work is currently ongoing to plan the 2nd edition of our workshop at ICRA 2024 to be held in Yokohama, Japan.</p> 

				<p>Between April'23 and October'24, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edoardo_Charbon">Prof. Edoardo Charbon's</a> <a href="http://aqua.epfl.ch">Advanced Quantum Architecture (AQUA) Laboratory</a> part of EPFL's Institute of Electrical and Micro Engineering in Lausanne, Switzerland. With the support of armasuisse Science & Technology (S+T)&mdash;the center of technology at the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS)&mdash;, we started multiple projects on the use of single-photon imaging technology for autonomous navigation of robots operating in perceptually challenging environments (extreme darkness/brightness, rapid light changes, high dynamic range, etc.).
				
				<p>I currently remain actively engaged in various aspects of my field as chair of the HERMES committee, co-chair of the <a href="http://isparo.space/">International Conference on Space Robotics (iSpaRo)</a>, member of the organizing committee for <a href="https://erf2024.eu/">ERF2024 Space Robotics Workshop</a>, member of <a href="https://eu-robotics.net/">euRobotics</a> TGs on Space Robotics, Autonomous Navigation, and Perception, member of IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, including its Technical Committees on <a href="https://ieee-ras.org/computer-robot-vision">Computer & Robot Vision</a>, <a href="https://www.ieee-ras.org/space-robotics">Space Robotics</a>, and <a href="https://www.ieee-ras.org/multi-robot-systems">Multi-Robot Systems</a>. I'm also guest editor for the <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10846">Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems (JINT)</a>.</p>
				
				<p>Throughout my career, I have been honored with prestigious grants and awards including the <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20170330/421300213184/ocho-espanoles-investigaran-en-japon-desastres-alimentacion-y-robotica.html">Japanese MEXT fellowship</a>, Tohoku University's GP Mech Award, and <a href="https://www.esa.int/Space_in_Member_States/United_Kingdom/Networking_Partnering_Initiative">ESA's Networking Partnering Initiative</a>. I have been invited to give numerous talks and seminars including presenting our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM4lWF6s4Ak">work on lunar robotics to the Embassy of Italy in Bern</a>, at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeIKUMiZOR8&t=120s">EPFL Space Center Public Seminar Series</a>, at the University of Luxembourg, and at the Space Tech Summit as part of the <a href="https://spacetechsummit.org/space-tech-summit-welcomes-global-innovators-for-digital-perspective-series-meet-david-rodriguez/">50 Global Innovators</a> track.</p> 
				
				<p>Alongside pursuing my own research, I have been mindful of the responsibility of guiding upcoming generations. Over the years, I have personally supervised (directed or co-directed) more than 25 graduate student projects—7 master's thesis and 21 semester/exchange student projects to date (full list <a href="assets/pdf/CV_RodriguezMartinez.pdf">here</a>)—and coordinated <a href="https://epfl-xplore.ch/">student initiatives involving more than 200 students</a>. While I haven't yet officially supervised any doctoral thesis, I have indirectly supported the work of 5 PhDs (3 in Tohoku and 2 at EPFL). During my time as a postdoc at EPFL, I taught and directed master's level courses on <a href="https://cdf.epfl.ch/eng411">Concurrent Engineering of Space Missions (ENG411)</a> and <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/spacecraft-design-and-system-engineering-EE-584">Spacecraft Design and Systems Engineering (EE584)</a>, with around 60 students enrolled every year.</p>
